# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Page titles

Every page under the site sets a route-specific `metadata.title` in the form `<Page Name> · Sanganak Works`, using a middle dot (`·`, U+00B7) with a space on each side as the separator. Never use an em dash, en dash, hyphen, pipe or colon. Examples: `Careers · Sanganak Works`, `Platform Engineer · Sanganak Works`. The home page alone uses the bare `Sanganak Works` from `src/app/layout.tsx`.
