            You wake up and look at your X timeline. Your feed is riddled with news of labs
            — American, Chinese, Japanese, occasionally Indian — building amazing things and
            pushing your imagination of what&apos;s possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get out of your house, ready for work, only to realize that the pothole in
            your road got even bigger due to the rain last night, the construction noises
            still persistent. The air still smells like shit and the people are hunched over
            their phones and lonely.
          </p>
          <p>
            You pop open your phone, book a Rapido, head over to LinkedIn to hear people
            complain.
          </p>
          <aside className={styles.complaintCallout}>
            <p>They are still complaining:</p>
            <ul aria-label="Complaints">
              {complaints.map((complaint) => (
                <li key={complaint}>{complaint}</li>

            And yet almost every company talks about AI transformation, how engineers will
            be out of jobs over the next 12 months (you&apos;ve been hearing this for 15
            months straight), how big techs are pushing employees to burn more tokens to
            bake in “more AI” into their product.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all this, you look up. Still the ugly dumping grounds, the musty smell,
            the honking during traffic, the dread of showing up to work and making up reasons
            why that AI feature is more important than serving real users.
          </p>

      <blockquote className={styles.manifestoQuote}>
        <p>
          How do they say everything has changed,

            We attributed the reason to a divide — opening up quickly and dangerously. While
            AI enables only some agentic people to do life-changing work, nothing really
            changes for the anxious student, the overworked doctor, the unaware career
            consultant, for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This divide is dangerous. It leads to decay and prevents India from becoming the
            land where people want to stay and make great things.

            While we cannot take on everything all at once, we&apos;re reimagining what it

            India.

            We also believe that you can work on something meaningful, from a place and with
            people you like, and yet not burn yourself out in the process.
