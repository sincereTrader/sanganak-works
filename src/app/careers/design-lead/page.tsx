          With <SarasLink />, we&apos;re building the accountability systems of the future for busy
          professionals. Design is not decoration here; it&apos;s how a product like Saras earns trust.
          You&apos;d own that: the brand, its artifacts, and the way it shows up across media and
          product surfaces.
