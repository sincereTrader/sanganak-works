              With <SarasLink />, we&apos;re building the accountability systems of the future for
              busy professionals. We&apos;re starting out by solving standardized test prep in a way
              that creates real outcomes for real users, beyond the benchmarks, with ambitions to
              make a huge dent in this $120B+ market.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we build through Saras feeds forward towards our even larger ambitions at
              Sanganak Works: to bring frontier technology to an exciting space where it can
              produce meaningful outcomes beyond benchmarks. We&apos;re independent, bootstrapped,
              remote-first but mission-oriented.
            </p>
            <p>
              The role involves dealing with a new class of software altogether, which is 80%
              configuration, 15% coding with agents and 5% tasteful intuition about systems. Which
              is why you&apos;d be expected to learn quickly, make mistakes and have a fun time working
              on important problem statements that matter to real people doing real things. Hermes,
              Codex and the rest of the stack are your co-workers; be ready to build the way
              engineering will get done in the future.

            <h2>About the role</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Own and evolve the platform that Saras runs on, custom-built with open source
                components. Make onboarding repeatable, and automate as much of the work as
                possible. By eliminating the recurring work over time, you create room for the
                higher-leverage parts of the charter
              </li>
              <li>
                Build messaging gateways that help Saras scale across platforms while preserving
                continuity. Saras lives on Telegram today, with WhatsApp and iMessage on the roadmap
              </li>
              <li>
                Build the systems around the agent: conversational intake, personalized study
                plans, routines, payments and integrations with proprietary 3P platforms
              </li>
              <li>
                Share your learnings through social channels and, where it makes sense, make open
                source contributions to high-profile projects. Build career capital and exemplify
                how to build outcome-driven agents

              <p>
                The stack is intentionally open-ended, but you&apos;ll work with autonomous AI agents,
                multi-tenant messaging, Docker, cron-driven automation, cloud deployment and agent
                frameworks in the Hermes/OpenClaw lineage. You&apos;ll also own the operational layer:
                per-profile logging, memory-integrity checks and gateway health. If you can reason
                about self-running agents and production cloud systems, you can pick up the
                specifics on the job.

            </article>
            <p className={styles.callout}>
              This is not a research-only or pure backend role. You&apos;ll configure agents, write the
              code and docs, make product calls, and own decisions from day one.
